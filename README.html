<H1>Assignment</H1>
Thursday, Assignment - due Thursday midnight:  

Use your imagination to create a web page that contains these four fields - -- anything more will be too much, especially if theres an error).:


credit card number
Credit card expiration date (use drop downs for month, day, and year)
Security code (allow either 3 or 4 digits, but no more!)
Error message box (see below)
Submit button
When submit button is clicked, validate these form fields. If all are OK, display an alert box stating that! If any are in error, use a label/innerHTML to place a message on the field in error on the web page itself.


Use one span tag for all error messages. Display the messages at the top of the page. 

Use the this.form technique we learned in week 2 to pass the form to the validation function. 

Do cross validation edits (make sure the month/day/year are all selected, and that they make sense - anotherwords, June 31 is not valid). 

Use a regular expression to validate the credit card number and security code

Assume the credit card number will be 16 digits, separated by dashes, as in nnnn-nnnn-nnnn-nnnn. Do NOT  use a regular expression to check for a valid card number, just a valid pattern, as shown above. Its too easy to copy these from the internet, so I am looking for this simpler edit, so that I know you wrote it yourself. 

Anything that appears to "internet-tie" (i.e. acquired from a website - I WILL KNOW) will be kicked back to you.


NOTE:  TEST ALL YOUR LINKS FROM YOUR HOME PAGE:
Create links on your home page to the coding assignment
FTP all content to your web server
Open a browser and go to your home page on the webserver. You should see your links.
Click each link to be sure your page works on the server.
If the links  do not work for you,  they will not work for me!
